ROUGH JS Outline (what are we going to need in it)

- maybe start by declaring a bunch of variables correlated with the dom
- event listener for our start game button that will run the code to start the game

- function to generate 5 random numbers and add each to an array.
- loop through this array, performing a fetch that will target the pokemon corresponding with number
- using the object provided, create a new object with id, name, and a picture keys
- Use this to create a new card element of just the picture, with a title of whatever card # it is
  - card element will also have blank text box below.

- function that will initialize a lives counter with a while loop.
  - this lives counter will start at a number and decrease by 1 if a guess is incorrect
  
- event listener that waits for a form submit.
- on form submit will check the values of each box 1-5
- will compare this to the corresponding name with matching object id created after our fetch
- if correct will change text color to green, will add pokemon name under picture in green
- if incorrect will change text color to red, will add correct pokemon name under picture in red
  - will subtract 1 from lives counter
- will initialize a score counter and add 1 for each correct answer
- will update title of div containing cards to reflect number correct out of 5
- if lives = 0 end game, load you lose screen
