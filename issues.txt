Going to try to keep this updated with issues im currently facing or think im going to run into

Current issue im thinking about: Accessing an array that is being pushed into via fetch.
    - My current code uses a forEach to perform multiple fetches, then pushes to an array.
    - My worry is attempting to access this array may run into bugs as due to the async nature of fetch,
    code will be loaded and executed before the fetch has pushed into the array. 
    - maybe by running code via event listener at a later time it will be fine? not sure, will have to test
