# Pokemon Guesser

My phase-1-project

## Description

This is a Game/App built using the PokeAPI. Starting the game loads 5 pictures of Pokemon from the 1st generation, along with a form to submit answers. You guess the Pokemon name, and type(s), earning points and losing lives along the way! How high of a score can you get!?

## Installation

https://github.com/Brodie/phase-1-project-pokeGuess

Navigate to the folder you wish to clone the app to, then after grabbing the SSH file run:

```bash
git clone SSH_file
```

Pasting the copied URL in place of 'SSH_file'

<br>

## Usage

This is a game! After cloning, run

```bash
explorer.exe PokeGame.html
```

Or if on mac

```bash
Open PokeGame.html
```

To open the game and begin playing!

## Roadmap

Planning on adding a dropdown to select different generations/play multiple generations of Pokemon at the same time.
